     * Hibernate is an ORM framework. It is an implementation of JPA (Java Persistence API).
     *
     * Map Java Bean to a table, and Hibernate takes care of generating queries to perform action on
     * that table depending on action performed on Java Bean. This concept is called ORM.
     *
     * Once the concept of ORM became popular and successful, JAVA EE wanted to standardize this concept.
     * JPA is just a specification (like an interface) that facilitates object relational mapping (ORM)
     * to manage relational data. It defines how you can map an entity to a table, it defines how you can
     * perform operations on that entity.
     *
     * Spring Data JPA is an abstraction layer on top of JPA to reduce the amount of boilerplate code
     * required to implement data access object (DAO). It uses Hibernate as a default JPA provider.
     *
     * JPA is a Java Persistence API. and it is renamed to Jakarta Persistence API.
