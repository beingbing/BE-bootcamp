            //      object once they are not needed, we do .close().

            // will be destroyed instantly.

            //      2. Another reason is, when a query is fired on DB server, some resources are
            //      created by DB server as well, like cursor and local objects. Once, you close
            //      the connection, all those object memory is freed as well.
