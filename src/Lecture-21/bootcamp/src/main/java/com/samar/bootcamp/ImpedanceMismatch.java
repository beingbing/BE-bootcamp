    * Q. What is the problem that JPA is trying to solve ?
    * A. On Java we have Objects, On DB side we have tables. Java is designed using OO Concepts
    *    however DB is designed using Relational data stores. Problem lies in difficulty to
    *    conceptually establish between these two models. This is called Impedance mismatch.
    *
    *    OO is mathematically directed graph whereas Relational is undirected graph.
